# Coquimbo Weather Report Review Summary

**Status:** NEEDS_REVISION (not yet ready for final delivery)

**Confidence:** HIGH

**Issues Identified**
- **Ambiguous wind description**: “WSW 10–20 mph (or WNW 6 mph)” presents contradictory wind directions/speeds without clarification.
- **Citation mismatch**: Footnote references Weather.com [5] but the Sources list entry [5] is ArabiaWeather; the Weather.com source is missing.
- **Citation consistency**: Every numeric citation used in the text must have a corresponding entry in the Sources section; ensure numbering aligns.

**Recommendations**
- Rewrite the wind description to a single, consistent statement (e.g., “Wind: WSW 10–20 mph” or clearly explain any directional/speed changes).
- Add Weather.com as a separate source (e.g., [9]) and update the footnote accordingly.
- Verify that all in‑text citations match entries in the Sources list; renumber if necessary.
- Optionally include a timestamp (e.g., “Data current as of 2025‑09‑26”) for transparency.

**Next Steps**
- **Technical Writer** to correct the wind description and citation issues.
- **Librarian** to verify updated source links and ensure citation numbering is correct.
- After revisions, conduct a final review to confirm readiness for delivery.
