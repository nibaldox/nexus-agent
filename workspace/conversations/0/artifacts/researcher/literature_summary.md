# Advantages of Electric Vehicles (EVs) Over Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) Vehicles

## 1. Emissions & Climate Impact
- Lifecycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are ~50% lower for EVs compared to ICE vehicles across typical usage scenarios (Union of Concerned Scientists) [1].
- EVs produce zero tailpipe pollutants (NOₓ, PM₂.₅), improving urban air quality.
- In regions with high renewable electricity shares, lifecycle emissions can exceed 70% reduction.

## 2. Energy Efficiency
- EVs convert ~77–90% of electrical energy to wheel power, whereas ICE vehicles only convert ~20–30% of gasoline energy (UCS Driving Cleaner Report) [2].
- This translates to an energy consumption of ~30 kWh per 100 mi (≈100 MPGe) vs ~500 kWh of gasoline energy for the same distance—a 3–4× efficiency gain.

## 3. Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)
- Fuel cost savings: EV drivers spend ~60% less annually on electricity vs gasoline (≈$0.60/mi vs $2.50/mi) (NRDC) [3].
- Maintenance costs are ~30% lower due to fewer moving parts (Consumer Reports) [4].
- Empirical TCO analyses show BEV TCO ≈ $60.9 k vs ICE ≈ $61.2 k (per $1,000 units) over vehicle lifetime, with segment‑specific reductions of 8.8 % (small cars) to 13.5 % (large SUVs) when incentives are applied (Wiley synthesis) [5].
- Overall, latest EVs often achieve lower lifetime TCO than comparable gasoline vehicles (Consumer Reports) [4].

## 4. Performance
- Instant torque delivers 0‑60 mph times under 3 seconds for many models, surpassing most ICE sports cars.
- Modern EVs offer 250–400 mi range per charge; fast‑charging can add ~200 mi in 15 min.
- Quieter operation and smoother acceleration enhance driving experience.
